# TrainTime

A train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains- namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

When adding trains, administrators can submit the following:
Train Name
Destination
First Train Time -- in military time
Frequency -- in minutes

This app calculates when the next train will arrive, relative to the current time.
Users from many different machines are able to view same train times.
